This is a little game engine that I made. I am somewhat proud of it because I think the graphics look really good for a rushed school project,
and the poker engine works almost perfectly (depending on your expectations).  

If you want to contribute, or steal this project without giving me any credits: feel free to do so. 

## Recommended environment

**Terminal**: Alacritty

I believe it will work on most terminals that support ascii scape characters, but since I didn't have the time to try it on other non-linux machines,
I guess someone will have to tell me if I'm right or wrong one day.

## Fixed Bugs :sob:
- [ ] Player forced to play even if there is no other _playable player_ in the turn.
- [ ] Bet price / Prize doesn't calculate properly with all-ins.

Unfortunately, I will need to wait until my teacher correct this assignment so I can start working on it again later ~~,but honestly I will never touch it again probably~~
